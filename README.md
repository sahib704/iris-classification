# Iris Flower Classification – Week 1 AI/ML Project

Hi!  
This is my first machine learning project, where I learned how to classify iris flowers using Python and some basic machine learning tools.

##  What is this project about?

The goal of this project is to **predict the species of an iris flower** based on the length and width of its petals and sepals. The three species are:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

##  Tools I Used

- **Google Colab** – to write and run code online
- **Python** – the programming language I used
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – for handling the data
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – for making graphs and charts
  - `sklearn` – to build and test the machine learning model

##  What I Did (Step-by-Step)

1. **Loaded the data** – I used a built-in iris dataset from sklearn.
2. **Explored the data** – I looked at what the data looks like, including numbers and charts.
3. **Split the data** – I separated the data into training and testing parts.
4. **Trained a model** – I used a simple model called K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
5. **Tested the model** – I checked how well it predicted using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
6. **Visualized the results** – I made some charts to understand the performance better.

##  What I Learned

- How to load and explore data
- How to train and test a machine learning model
- How to check if the model is working well
- How to organize code and results clearly

##  About Me

I'm a beginner in AI and ML, and this is my very first project!  
I’m excited to keep learning and building more cool things.
